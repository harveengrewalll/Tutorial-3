## Tutorial 3: JS Objects 

In this tutorial you'll practice working with JS object.

The instructions are provided as comments in the Tutorial_3.js file.

Please note that, you may know of other ways to do the required actions, however, the objective is to practice the concepts and the constructs not to do the action per se, so please make sure to follow the instructions in the code file.

Your main goal is to successfully print the cleaned points using a for loop. You can submit a screenshot of your output as proof that you’ve met the requirement.

Please do not focus on the test.js files; those are for GitHub Classroom AutoGrading. You WILL receive full marks if you submit a screenshot showing the correct output, even if you didn’t pass the test.
